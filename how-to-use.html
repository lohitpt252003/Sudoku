        <h1>How to Play Sudoku</h1>
        <p>Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.</p>

        <h2>Basic Rules:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each row must contain all digits from 1 to 9.</li>
            <li>Each column must contain all digits from 1 to 9.</li>
            <li>Each of the nine 3×3 subgrids must contain all digits from 1 to 9.</li>
            <li>No digit can be repeated in the same row, column, or 3×3 subgrid.</li>
        </ul>
